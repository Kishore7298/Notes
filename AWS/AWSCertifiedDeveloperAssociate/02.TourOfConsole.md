## AWS Console Tour

### Region Selector

* Found at **top-right** of the AWS Console.
* Example default region: **US East 1 (N. Virginia)**
* Recommended: choose a region **closest to you** for low latency

  * Europe example: **EU West 1 (Ireland)**
  * Africa example: **Cape Town**

> You do not need to physically be in the region to use it.

Stay in the **same region throughout the course** to avoid confusion.

### Console Home Page Overview

* Shows:

  * Recently visited services
  * Account health info
  * Cost & usage info
  * Tutorials & solution guides
* UI changes frequently over time (AWS updates the console often)

### Navigating Services

Two methods to access services:

#### 1. Services Menu (Top-Left)

* Browse by:

  * **Alphabetical list**
  * **Category** (e.g., Compute, Storage, Networking)

#### 2. Search Bar

* Search by service name (example: `Route 53`)
* Search results include:

  * Services
  * Features
  * Blogs
  * Articles
  * Documentation

### Global vs Regional Services

#### Global Services

* Example: **Route 53**
* Console shows **Global** in the top-right
* Same view regardless of region

#### Regional Services

* Example: **EC2**
* Console shows selected region (e.g., Ireland)
* Resources vary by region
* Important to stay consistent in one region during learning

### AWS Global Infrastructure Reference

* Check **AWS Global Infrastructure** site (Google it)
* Useful page: **AWS Regional Services List**

  * Shows which services are available in each region
  * If a service is missing in your region:

    * Switch regions in the console

Example:

* Search for **Cape Town** region to see available services
