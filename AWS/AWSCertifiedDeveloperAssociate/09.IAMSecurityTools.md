## IAM Security Tools

### **1. Overview**

IAM provides built-in **security auditing tools** to help maintain and monitor account security.
These tools help ensure that your AWS environment follows the **principle of least privilege** — giving users only the permissions they actually need.

---

### **2. IAM Credentials Report**

* **Scope:** Account-level
* **Purpose:** Provides a summary of **all IAM users** and the status of their credentials.
* **Includes Information Such As:**

  * Whether a user has **active access keys**
  * Whether **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** is enabled
  * The **age of passwords** and **access keys**
  * When credentials were last rotated or used
* **Use Case:**
  Helps identify:

  * Unused or outdated credentials
  * Users without MFA
  * Security risks like overly permissive or inactive accounts

---

### **3. IAM Access Advisor**

* **Scope:** User-level
* **Purpose:** Shows which **AWS services** a user has permission to access **and when they were last accessed**.
* **Helps You Identify:**

  * **Unused permissions** that can be safely removed
  * Users or roles with **over-provisioned access**
* **Supports the Principle of Least Privilege:**
  You can analyze this data to refine IAM policies and grant only necessary permissions.

### **4. Comparison Table**

| Tool                   | Scope         | Purpose                                         | Use Case                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credentials Report** | Account-level | Lists all IAM users and their credential status | Identify unused passwords/keys, enforce MFA        |
| **Access Advisor**     | User-level    | Shows services accessed and last access time    | Remove unused permissions, tighten access policies |

---

### **5. Key Takeaway**

These IAM tools are critical for **security auditing and optimization**:

* Use **Credentials Report** to monitor credential hygiene across your account.
* Use **Access Advisor** to ensure users and roles adhere to the **least privilege** model.
