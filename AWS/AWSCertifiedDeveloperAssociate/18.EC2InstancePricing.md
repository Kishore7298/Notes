# 💰 EC2 Instance Purchasing Options

AWS offers several ways to pay for EC2 instances — each optimized for different workload patterns, durations, and pricing needs.

---

## ⚡ On-Demand Instances

**Best for:** Short-term, unpredictable workloads
**Billing:**

* Linux/Windows → per second (after first minute)
* Other OS → per hour

**Key Points:**

* No upfront payment, no long-term commitment
* Highest cost per hour
* Ideal for testing, short-lived, or unpredictable workloads

---

## 📆 Reserved Instances (RI)

**Best for:** Steady-state, long-running workloads (e.g., databases)
**Term:** 1 or 3 years
**Discount:** Up to **72%** vs. on-demand

**Commitment Includes:**

* Instance type, region, tenancy, and OS
* Payment options:

  * No upfront
  * Partial upfront
  * All upfront (maximum discount)

**Scope:**

* **Regional RI:** applies to any AZ in the region
* **Zonal RI:** reserves specific AZ capacity

**Convertible RIs:**

* Allow changes to instance type, family, OS, or tenancy
* More flexibility → slightly smaller discount (≈ 66%)

**Extras:**

* Can be bought/sold on the **RI Marketplace**

---

## 💵 Savings Plans

**Best for:** Long-term, consistent compute usage
**Term:** 1 or 3 years
**Discount:** Up to **70%** vs. on-demand

**How It Works:**

* Commit to a specific **spend rate** (e.g., `$10/hour`)
* Usage beyond the commitment billed at on-demand rates

**Types:**

* **Compute Savings Plan:** flexible across instance families, regions, OS, and tenancy
* **EC2 Instance Savings Plan:** locked to instance family and region, flexible across size/OS/tenancy

**Example:**
Commit to M5 family in `us-east-1` — can use `m5.large`, `m5.2xlarge`, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Spot Instances

**Best for:** Fault-tolerant, flexible, short-term workloads
**Discount:** Up to **90%** vs. on-demand

**How It Works:**

* Set a **maximum bid price**
* If the current spot price > your bid → instance is **terminated**

**Use Cases:**

* Batch jobs
* Data analysis
* Image processing
* Distributed or flexible workloads

**Not suitable for:**

* Critical jobs or databases (because of interruption risk)

---

## 🖥️ Dedicated Hosts

**Best for:** Compliance or license-bound workloads
**What You Get:**

* Entire physical server dedicated to you
* Full control over instance placement

**Billing Options:**

* On-Demand (per second)
* 1- or 3-year reservation

**Use Cases:**

* BYOL (Bring Your Own License) software
* Per-socket, per-core, or per-VM licensing
* Regulatory or compliance requirements

**Most expensive** option due to full hardware isolation

---

## 🧱 Dedicated Instances

**Best for:** Dedicated hardware without managing physical hosts

**Key Points:**

* Runs on hardware dedicated to your account
* You **don’t control placement** on the physical server
* May share hardware with other instances in your account

**Difference vs. Dedicated Host:**

* **Dedicated Host:** full visibility and control over hardware
* **Dedicated Instance:** no visibility, but still dedicated hardware

---

## 🧩 Capacity Reservations

**Best for:** Ensuring instance availability in a specific AZ

**Features:**

* Reserve on-demand capacity in an **Availability Zone (AZ)**
* No time commitment → can cancel anytime
* **No billing discount** — charged at on-demand rates
* Charged even if unused

**Combine With:**
Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for discounts

**Use Case:**
Short-term, uninterrupted workloads that must run in a specific AZ

## 🏨 Analogy — “Resort Comparison”

| Purchasing Option        | Resort Analogy                                      | Key Idea                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **On-Demand**            | Walk into the resort anytime, pay full price        | Flexibility, high cost        |
| **Reserved Instance**    | Book your room 1–3 years ahead for discount         | Commitment → lower cost       |
| **Savings Plan**         | Commit to spending $X/month, change rooms as needed | Commit $ spend, not instance  |
| **Spot Instance**        | Last-minute hotel deal — may lose room anytime      | Super cheap, can end suddenly |
| **Dedicated Host**       | Rent the entire hotel building                      | Full hardware control         |
| **Capacity Reservation** | Reserve a room (pay even if unused)                 | Guaranteed capacity           |

## 💸 Example Pricing Snapshot (illustrative)

| Instance Type            | Example               | Discount / Notes              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **On-Demand**            | $0.10/hr              | Baseline                      |
| **Spot**                 | Up to 90% off         | Cheapest, volatile            |

| **Convertible RI**       | Up to 66% off         | Flexible instance change      |
| **Savings Plan**         | Up to 70% off         | Commit $/hour                 |
| **Dedicated Host**       | On-Demand or reserved | Most expensive                |
| **Capacity Reservation** | On-Demand rate        | No discount, ensures capacity |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **On-Demand:** flexibility, no commitment
* **Reserved / Savings Plan:** long-term cost optimization
* **Spot:** short, flexible jobs at lowest cost
* **Dedicated Host:** compliance and licensing needs
* **Capacity Reservation:** guarantee capacity, pay full price
