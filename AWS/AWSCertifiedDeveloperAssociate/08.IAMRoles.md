## IAM Roles

### **1. What Are IAM Roles?**

* **IAM Roles** are a key component of **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.
* They are similar to IAM users in that they define **permissions**.
* However, unlike users, **roles are not associated with physical people**.
* Instead, **roles are meant to be assumed by AWS services** (e.g., EC2, Lambda) or other entities that need temporary permissions.

---

### **2. Why IAM Roles Are Needed**

* Some AWS services need to **perform actions on your behalf**.
* Example:

  * An **EC2 Instance** might need to read data from an **S3 bucket**.
  * The instance itself doesn’t have credentials, so it uses an **IAM Role** attached to it.
* The role grants **temporary permissions** that the service can use securely without storing access keys.

### **3. How IAM Roles Work**

1. You **create a role** in IAM.
2. You **assign permissions policies** to that role (what the service is allowed to do).
3. You **attach the role** to an AWS service (e.g., EC2 instance, Lambda function).
4. When that service tries to access another AWS resource, it **assumes the role**.
5. AWS automatically provides **temporary credentials** to perform the allowed actions.

### **4. Common Use Cases for IAM Roles**

| Use Case                  | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 Instance Role**     | Allows EC2 instances to access other AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).                |
| **Lambda Execution Role** | Grants AWS Lambda functions permission to access resources like CloudWatch Logs or S3. |
| **CloudFormation Role**   | Lets CloudFormation create or manage resources on your behalf during stack creation.   |

### **5. Key Points**

* Roles **do not require access keys or passwords**.
* Roles are **temporary and automatically rotated** by AWS.
* They improve **security** by removing the need for hard-coded credentials.
* One role can be used by **multiple services** if permissions align.

### **6. Summary**

| Concept              | User                                   | Role                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Used by**          | People                                 | AWS services or other entities                    |
| **Has credentials?** | Yes (username/password or access keys) | No (temporary credentials assigned automatically) |
| **Primary purpose**  | Long-term identity                     | Delegated, temporary permissions                  |
| **Example**          | Admin user logging in                  | EC2 instance reading from S3                      |
