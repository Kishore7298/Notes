### 🧠 EBS Snapshots (AWS EC2)

**Definition:**

* EBS Snapshot = a **point-in-time backup** of an EBS volume.
* You **don’t need to detach** the volume from the EC2 instance to create a snapshot (though it’s recommended for consistency).
* Snapshots can be **copied across Availability Zones (AZs)** or even **across AWS Regions**.

---

### 📦 Example Scenario

* EC2 instance in **us-east-1a** has an **EBS volume**.
* EC2 instance in **us-east-1b** wants a copy.
* Steps:

  1. Take a **snapshot** of the EBS volume in us-east-1a.
  2. **Restore** that snapshot into us-east-1b.

This effectively **transfers an EBS volume between AZs**.

    C --> D[Restore Snapshot in us-east-1b]
    D --> E[EC2 Instance us-east-1b]
```

### ⚙️ EBS Snapshot Features

#### 1. **EBS Snapshot Archive**

* Moves snapshots to an **archive tier** (cheaper storage).
* **Cost:** Up to **75% cheaper** than standard snapshots.
* **Restore time:** **24–72 hours** (not immediate).
* Ideal for **long-term retention** where fast access is not needed.

---

#### 2. **Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots**

* Prevents **accidental permanent deletion**.
* When deleted, snapshots go to a **Recycle Bin** instead of being erased.
* **Retention period:** can be set from **1 day to 1 year**.
* Allows **easy recovery** within that retention window.

```mermaid

    A[Delete Snapshot] --> B[Recycle Bin]
    B -->|Within Retention| C[Recover Snapshot]
    B -->|After Expiry| D[Permanent Deletion]
```

---

#### 3. **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)**

* Performs **full initialization** upfront.
* Eliminates **first-use latency** when creating a volume from a snapshot.
* Useful for **large snapshots** or when you need **instant readiness**.
* **Cost:** High — use only when required.
