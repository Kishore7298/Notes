## IAM Best Practices

### **1. Root Account Usage**

* ❌ **Never use the root account** except for **initial setup** or very specific administrative tasks.
* ✅ Use your **IAM user account** for day-to-day operations.
* Keep root credentials **secure and private** — enable **MFA** on the root account.

---

### **2. User Management**

* Each **IAM user = one physical person**.
* Do **not share credentials** — if someone else needs access, **create a new user** for them.
* Group users by their roles or departments (e.g., *Developers*, *Admins*, *Ops*).
* Apply **permissions at the group level** instead of assigning them individually.
  → Easier and safer to manage.

---

### **3. Security Controls**

* Implement a **strong password policy**:

  * Minimum length
  * Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  * Enforce password rotation
* **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for:

  * Root account
  * All IAM users, especially those with administrative privileges

---

### **4. Using Roles**

* Always use **IAM Roles** when assigning permissions to **AWS services** (like EC2, Lambda, etc.).
* Roles eliminate the need to store long-term credentials within your code or instances.

---

### **5. Programmatic Access**

* Use **Access Keys** only when accessing AWS via:

  * **CLI (Command Line Interface)**
  * **SDK (Software Development Kit)**
* Treat access keys as **highly confidential credentials**:

  * Never share them
  * Never commit them to source control (e.g., GitHub)
  * Rotate them periodically

---

### **6. Monitoring & Auditing**

* Use IAM **Credentials Report** to audit all users and credential status.
* Use **Access Advisor** to review service access history and remove unused permissions.
* Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege** — only grant what’s necessary.

---

### **7. Golden Rules**

✅ Use IAM users, not the root account
✅ Group users and manage permissions via policies
✅ Enforce MFA and strong passwords
✅ Use IAM Roles for AWS services
✅ Keep access keys private
✅ Regularly audit using IAM security tools

---

### **Conclusion**

You now know:

* How IAM manages users, groups, roles, and permissions
* How to secure your AWS account using best practices
* How to monitor and maintain least-privilege access

🎯 **Goal:** Always aim for a secure, minimal-permission AWS environment.
