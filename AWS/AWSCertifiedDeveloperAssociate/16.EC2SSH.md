# 🧠 Connecting to EC2 Instances (SSH & EC2 Instance Connect)

When running servers in the cloud, you’ll often need to **connect into them** to perform maintenance or configuration.
For **Linux EC2 instances**, this is typically done using **SSH (Secure Shell)**.

## 🧩 Connection Methods by Operating System

| Operating System                   | Recommended Method       | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mac / Linux**                    | `ssh` command (built-in) | Use the terminal CLI.                                        |
| **Windows 10+**                    | `ssh` command (built-in) | Available in PowerShell / Command Prompt.                    |
| **Windows < 10**                   | **PuTTY**                | External app that provides SSH functionality.                |
| **Any OS (Mac / Linux / Windows)** | **EC2 Instance Connect** | Uses your **web browser** to connect—no installation needed. |

## 🧰 Tools Overview

### 🔹 SSH (Secure Shell)

* Command-line utility used to securely connect to a remote Linux server.
* Syntax example:

  ```bash
  ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
  ```
* Supported on Mac, Linux, and Windows 10+ natively.

### 🔹 PuTTY (for older Windows versions)

* External software providing the same functionality as SSH.
* Use `.ppk` key file format (PuTTY-specific).
* Great option if your Windows version doesn’t include SSH.

### 🔹 EC2 Instance Connect

* **Browser-based SSH** connection.
* No CLI or app installation required.
* Works across **Mac, Linux, and all Windows versions**.
* Currently supports **Amazon Linux 2** instances.
* Convenient for quick access or troubleshooting.

## ⚠️ Common SSH Troubles

If SSH isn’t working:

* 🔒 **Check Security Group rules:** Ensure **port 22** is open for your IP.
* 🧩 **Verify key permissions:** The `.pem` file should have proper read permissions (`chmod 400`).
* 🖋️ **Check for typos** in username, IP, or key file name.
* 🧱 **Try EC2 Instance Connect** — often resolves SSH setup issues instantly.

> 💡 Only **one method needs to work**.
> If SSH or EC2 Instance Connect connects successfully, you’re good to proceed.

## 🧭 Key Takeaways

* SSH = primary method for connecting to Linux EC2 instances.
* PuTTY = backup option for older Windows systems.
* EC2 Instance Connect = browser-based, easiest option for beginners.
* If SSH fails, recheck your **security group**, **key file**, and **command syntax**.
* Troubleshooting guides are available if you encounter connection issues.
