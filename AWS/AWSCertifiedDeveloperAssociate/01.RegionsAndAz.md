* Edge locations
* Points of presence

AWS has a global private network connecting regions.

## AWS Regions

* Physically separate geographic areas.
* Named like `us-east-1`, `eu-west-3`, `ap-south-1`, etc.
* Each region contains multiple data centers.

### How to Choose a Region

| Factor               | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compliance           | Data residency laws (e.g., France data stays in France) |
| Latency              | Pick region closest to users                            |
| Service availability | Some services not available in all regions              |
| Pricing              | Prices vary across regions                              |

## Availability Zones (AZs)

* Each region typically has **3 AZs** (min 3, max ~6)
* Example: Sydney = `ap-southeast-2A`, `2B`, `2C`
* Each AZ = one or more isolated data centers
* Designed for fault isolation
* Connected by **high-bandwidth, low-latency** networking
* All AZs together form a region

---

## Edge Locations / Points of Presence

* **400+ PoPs** in **90 cities** across **40 countries**
* Used to deliver content with minimal latency
* Used in services like **CloudFront** (CDN)

---

### Global Services (not region-scoped)

* IAM
* Route 53
