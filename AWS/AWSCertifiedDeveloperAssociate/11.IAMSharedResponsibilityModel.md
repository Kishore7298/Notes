## Shared Responsibility Model – IAM Context

### **Overview**

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines **who is responsible for what** in terms of **security and compliance** between AWS and the **customer (you)**.

* AWS manages and secures the **infrastructure**.
* You manage **how** you use that infrastructure.

---

### **AWS Responsibilities**

AWS is responsible **for the security *of* the cloud**, including:

* Physical infrastructure (data centers, networking, hardware).
* Global network and infrastructure security.
* Configuration and vulnerability management of **AWS-managed services**.
* Maintenance and patching of AWS systems.
* Compliance for the AWS global infrastructure (e.g., ISO, SOC, PCI).

---

### **Customer Responsibilities (You)**

You are responsible **for security *in* the cloud**, specifically within your AWS account:

* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**

  * Creating and managing **users, groups, roles, and policies**.
  * Enabling and enforcing **MFA** for all accounts.
  * **Rotating access keys** and securing credentials.
  * Managing and reviewing **permissions and access levels**.
  * Monitoring and analyzing **access patterns**.
* Using IAM tools such as:

  * **Access Advisor** and **Credentials Report** to review and optimize access.
* Applying **least privilege principle** across all IAM entities.

| -------------------------------- | --- | -------------- |
| Physical infrastructure          | ✅   | ❌              |
| Global network security          | ✅   | ❌              |
| Service configuration security   | ✅   | ❌              |
| User, group, and role management | ❌   | ✅              |
| MFA enforcement                  | ❌   | ✅              |
| Access key rotation              | ❌   | ✅              |
| Permissions review and auditing  | ❌   | ✅              |
| Compliance of infrastructure     | ✅   | ❌              |

### **Key Takeaway**

> **AWS secures the cloud. You secure what’s in it.**
> You are fully responsible for managing and protecting IAM configurations and access within your AWS account.
