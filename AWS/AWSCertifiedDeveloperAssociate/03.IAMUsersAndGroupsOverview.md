## AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Overview

* **IAM** stands for **Identity and Access Management**.
* It’s a **global service** (not tied to a specific region).
* Used to:

  * Manage **users**, **groups**, and **permissions**.
  * Control access to AWS resources.

---

### Root User

* Created automatically when you first create an AWS account.
* Has **full access** to all AWS resources.
* Best practice:

  * Use the root user **only** for initial setup.
  * **Never** share or use it for daily operations.

---

### IAM Users

* Each **user** represents **one person** (or entity) in your organization.
* Users are created under IAM (not via the root account).
* Each user:

  * Has their own credentials.
  * Can be assigned permissions (via policies).
  * Can belong to one or more groups.

---

### IAM Groups

* **Groups** are collections of users with similar responsibilities.
* Purpose: manage permissions for multiple users at once.
* **Rules:**

  * Groups can **only contain users** (not other groups).
  * A user can belong to **multiple groups**.
  * A user **can exist without** belonging to any group (not best practice).

**Example:**

```
Developers Group: Alice, Bob, Charles
Operations Group: David, Edward
Audit Group: Charles, David
```

* Charles and David are in **two groups**.
* Fred is a standalone user (no group).

---

### IAM Policies

* **Policies** define permissions using a **JSON document**.
* They describe **what actions** are allowed or denied on **which resources**.

**Example IAM Policy:**

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
        "cloudwatch:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

* Grants permission to **describe** resources in EC2, ELB, and CloudWatch.
* Assigned to **users** or **groups**.

---

### Principle of Least Privilege

* Core IAM best practice:

  * **Grant only the permissions a user needs** to perform their tasks.
  * Prevents:

    * Unnecessary costs (from unauthorized service usage)
    * Security risks (from over-privileged users)

---

### Summary

* IAM is global.
* Use **root user** only for setup.
* Create **users** and **groups** for daily management.
* Assign **policies** to define access permissions.
* Always follow the **least privilege principle**.
