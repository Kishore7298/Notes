# **Amazon EC2 – Introduction**

## **1. What is EC2?**

* **EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.
* It is one of the **most popular AWS services**, forming the backbone of AWS Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
* EC2 allows you to **rent virtual servers** (called **EC2 Instances**) on demand.

## **2. EC2 as Infrastructure-as-a-Service**

EC2 is not just one single service — it includes several components that work together:

| **Component**                   | **Purpose**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 Instances**               | Virtual machines you can rent from AWS.                  |
| **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**   | Network-attached storage volumes for persistent data.    |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** | Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.       |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**    | Automatically adds or removes instances based on demand. |

> EC2 forms the core of AWS computing power — providing scalable, on-demand infrastructure.

## **3. EC2 Instance Configuration Options**

When creating an EC2 instance, you can customize multiple aspects:

### **a. Operating System**

Choose from:

* **Linux** (most popular)
* **Windows**
* **macOS**

### **b. Compute Power**

* Choose **CPU type** and **number of cores** as needed.

### **c. Memory (RAM)**

* Select how much **memory** your instance should have.

### **d. Storage**

Choose between:

* **EBS / EFS:** Network-attached storage (persistent).
* **Instance Store:** Hardware-attached storage (temporary).

> More details on storage types will be covered in the Storage section.

### **e. Networking**

* Configure network performance, **public IP**, and **network interface** type.

### **f. Security**

* Define **firewall rules** using **Security Groups** (control inbound/outbound traffic).

### **g. Boot Configuration (EC2 User Data)**

* Run initialization commands automatically when the instance first launches.

## **4. EC2 User Data (Bootstrapping)**

### **What is Bootstrapping?**

* Bootstrapping = Running **initial setup commands** automatically when an instance starts for the first time.

### **Purpose**

Automate tasks at launch such as:

* Installing software or updates.
* Downloading files from the internet.
* Configuring services or applications.

### **Notes**

* EC2 User Data scripts **run only once** (at the first boot).
* Executed with **root privileges** — no need for `sudo`.
* More complex scripts = longer boot time.

---

## **5. Why EC2 Matters**

* EC2 demonstrates the **core idea of the cloud** — **rent compute power on demand**.
* You can provision, configure, and start servers **within seconds**.
* It’s the **foundation** for most AWS services and applications.

✅ **In summary:**

> Amazon EC2 lets you **launch, configure, and manage virtual servers** in the cloud.
> You control the OS, CPU, memory, storage, network, and startup behavior — all with on-demand scalability.
