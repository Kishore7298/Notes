# **Amazon EC2 – Introduction**

## **1. What is EC2?**

* **EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.
* It is one of the **most popular AWS services**, forming the backbone of AWS Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
* EC2 allows you to **rent virtual servers** (called **EC2 Instances**) on demand.

---

## **2. EC2 as Infrastructure-as-a-Service**

EC2 is not just one single service — it includes several components that work together:

| **Component**                   | **Purpose**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 Instances**               | Virtual machines you can rent from AWS.                  |
| **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**   | Network-attached storage volumes for persistent data.    |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** | Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.       |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**    | Automatically adds or removes instances based on demand. |

> EC2 forms the core of AWS computing power — providing scalable, on-demand infrastructure.

---

## **3. EC2 Instance Configuration Options**

When creating an EC2 instance, you can customize multiple aspects:

### **a. Operating System**

Choose from:

* **Linux** (most popular)
* **Windows**
* **macOS**

### **b. Compute Power**

* Choose **CPU type** and **number of cores** as needed.

### **c. Memory (RAM)**

* Select how much **memory** your instance should have.

### **d. Storage**

Choose between:

* **EBS / EFS:** Network-attached storage (persistent).
* **Instance Store:** Hardware-attached storage (temporary).

> More details on storage types will be covered in the Storage section.

### **e. Networking**

* Configure network performance, **public IP**, and **network interface** type.

### **f. Security**

* Define **firewall rules** using **Security Groups** (control inbound/outbound traffic).

### **g. Boot Configuration (EC2 User Data)**

* Run initialization commands automatically when the instance first launches.

---

## **4. EC2 User Data (Bootstrapping)**

### **What is Bootstrapping?**

* Bootstrapping = Running **initial setup commands** automatically when an instance starts for the first time.

### **Purpose**

Automate tasks at launch such as:

* Installing software or updates.
* Downloading files from the internet.
* Configuring services or applications.

### **Notes**

* EC2 User Data scripts **run only once** (at the first boot).
* Executed with **root privileges** — no need for `sudo`.
* More complex scripts = longer boot time.

---

## **5. Why EC2 Matters**

* EC2 demonstrates the **core idea of the cloud** — **rent compute power on demand**.
* You can provision, configure, and start servers **within seconds**.
* It’s the **foundation** for most AWS services and applications.

---

✅ **In summary:**

> Amazon EC2 lets you **launch, configure, and manage virtual servers** in the cloud.
> You control the OS, CPU, memory, storage, network, and startup behavior — all with on-demand scalability.

# **Launching Your First EC2 Instance**

## **1. Overview**

In this hands-on, we’ll launch our first **Amazon EC2 instance** running **Amazon Linux**, configure it, and deploy a simple web server.
We’ll also learn how to **start, stop, and terminate** instances.

---

## **2. Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance**

### **Step 1: Open EC2 Console**

* Go to the **EC2 Console → Instances → Launch Instance**.

### **Step 2: Add Name and Tags**

* **Name**: `My First Instance`
* Tags are optional but help organize resources.

---

### **Step 3: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**

* Select **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** (Free Tier eligible).
* **Architecture:** 64-bit (x86).
* You can later create your own AMIs, but for now, use AWS Quick Start AMIs.

---

### **Step 4: Choose Instance Type**

* Select **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible).
* You can view and compare all instance types (CPU, memory, pricing, etc.).
* Some regions might offer **t3.micro** instead.

---

### **Step 5: Create or Select Key Pair**

* Key pairs are used for **SSH access** to the instance.
* Create a new key pair:

  * **Name:** `EC2-Tutorial`
  * **Type:** RSA
  * **Format:**

    * `.pem` → for macOS, Linux, or Windows 10+
    * `.ppk` → for Windows 7/8 (PuTTY users)
* Download and keep it safe — this is the only time AWS lets you download it.

---

### **Step 6: Configure Network Settings**

* Default VPC and subnet are selected.
* The instance will automatically receive a **public IPv4 address**.
* **Security Group:** Automatically created (e.g., `launch-wizard-1`).

  * Allow **SSH (port 22)** from anywhere.
  * Allow **HTTP (port 80)** from anywhere.
  * Outbound rules: Allow all traffic to the Internet.

---

### **Step 7: Configure Storage**

* Default: 8 GB gp2 (SSD) **root volume**.
* Free Tier allows up to **30 GB of EBS storage**.
* Option: “Delete on termination” is **enabled by default** (volume deleted when instance is terminated).

---

### **Step 8: Add User Data (Bootstrapping)**

At the bottom, under **Advanced Details → User Data**, paste a startup script that:

* Updates packages
* Installs the Apache (HTTPD) web server
* Creates a simple “Hello World” HTML page

> The script runs **only once** at the first launch and executes as **root**.

---

### **Step 9: Review and Launch**

* Verify settings, confirm Free Tier usage, then click **Launch Instance**.
* View instance under **Instances → My First Instance**.

## **3. Understanding the EC2 Instance**

| **Attribute**      | **Description**                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instance ID**    | Unique identifier for your instance                    |
| **Public IPv4**    | Used to connect over the Internet (changes on restart) |
| **Private IPv4**   | Internal AWS network address (stays the same)          |
| **AMI**            | Amazon Linux 2                                         |
| **Instance Type**  | t2.micro                                               |
| **Key Pair**       | EC2-Tutorial                                           |
| **Security Group** | Allows SSH (22) and HTTP (80)                          |

---

## **4. Test the Web Server**

* Copy the **public IPv4 address**.
* Open in a browser:

  ```text
  http://<public-ipv4-address>
  ```
* Ensure to use **HTTP**, not HTTPS.
* You should see:

  ```
  Hello World from 172-31-33-135
  ```

  (where the IP shown is the **private IPv4**).

> If it doesn’t work immediately, wait a few minutes for setup to complete and refresh.

---

## **5. Instance Lifecycle Operations**

### **Stop Instance**

* Action: `Instance State → Stop Instance`
* Effect: Instance shuts down; **no compute charges** while stopped.
* **EBS volume** persists (you’re still billed for storage).

### **Start Instance**

* Action: `Instance State → Start Instance`
* Instance restarts with **same private IP**, but **new public IP**.
  → Update the new IP in your browser.

### **Terminate Instance**

* Action: `Instance State → Terminate Instance`
* Permanently deletes the instance and its attached volume (if “delete on termination” enabled).

---

## **6. Key Takeaways**

* **EC2** allows you to launch virtual servers in seconds — no physical hardware required.
* **Public IPs** can change after stopping/starting; **private IPs** remain constant.
* **User Data** automates software installation and setup.
* **Security Groups** control inbound/outbound network traffic.
* You pay only while the instance is running.

---

✅ **Summary**

> You successfully launched your **first web server** on AWS using EC2.
> You learned how to configure, access, start/stop, and terminate an instance — demonstrating the true **flexibility and speed of the cloud**.
