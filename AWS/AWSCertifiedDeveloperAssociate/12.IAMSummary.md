# **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Complete Notes**

---

## **1. Introduction to IAM**

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to **securely control access** to AWS services and resources.
It helps you manage **who is authenticated (signs in)** and **authorized (has permissions)** to use AWS resources.

---

## **2. IAM Users**

* **IAM User** = represents a **real physical person** or application needing AWS access.
* Each user has:

  * A **username** and **password** for console login.
  * Optionally, **Access Keys (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key)** for CLI or SDK access.
* One AWS user = one real individual — **never share user accounts**.
* Permissions for a user are defined via **IAM policies**.

---

## **3. IAM Groups**

* **IAM Groups** = logical collections of users.
* Groups **cannot contain other groups** — only users.
* Permissions are attached to **groups**, and users in the group automatically inherit them.
* This makes managing permissions easier across teams (e.g., *Admins*, *Developers*, *Testers*).

---

## **4. IAM Policies**

* **Policies** are **JSON documents** defining *what actions* are allowed or denied on *which resources*.
* Example structure:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
* Policies can be attached to:

  * **Users**
  * **Groups**
  * **Roles**
* They enforce **fine-grained permissions** in AWS.

---

## **5. IAM Roles**

* **IAM Roles** are similar to users but meant for **AWS services** (not humans).
* They provide **temporary credentials** to access AWS resources.
* Common role examples:

  * **EC2 Instance Roles** – allow an instance to call AWS APIs.
  * **Lambda Roles** – allow functions to interact with other AWS resources.
  * **CloudFormation Roles** – allow templates to create/manage resources.
* A role defines *what the service can do* on your behalf.

---

## **6. Authentication Methods**

There are **three main ways to access AWS:**

### **a. AWS Management Console**

* Web-based UI for managing services.
* Protected by **username + password + MFA**.

### **b. AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**

* Allows you to run AWS commands directly from your terminal.
* Protected using **Access Keys** (downloaded once).
* Enables scripting and automation.
* Built using the AWS SDK for Python (**Boto3**).

### **c. AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)**

* Enables programmatic access through code.
* Language-specific libraries available for:

  * Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, .NET, C++, etc.
* Used to integrate AWS into applications, mobile apps, and IoT devices.

---

## **7. Security Tools in IAM**

### **a. IAM Credentials Report**

* Account-level report listing all users and their credential status.
* Helps identify:

  * Users with old passwords or inactive access keys.
  * Users without MFA enabled.

### **b. IAM Access Advisor**

* User-level tool that shows:

  * Which AWS services a user has access to.
  * When those services were last accessed.
* Useful for **applying least privilege** — removing unused permissions.

---

## **8. IAM Best Practices**

* **Never use the root account** except for initial setup.
* Create **individual IAM users** for each person.
* Assign permissions through **groups**, not individual users.
* Enforce **strong password policies**.
* Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on all accounts.
* Use **IAM Roles** for AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
* Rotate **access keys** regularly and keep them private.
* Review and adjust permissions periodically using:

  * **IAM Credentials Report**
  * **IAM Access Advisor**
* **Never share** IAM users or access keys with others.

---

## **9. Shared Responsibility Model (in context of IAM)**

Understanding who is responsible for what is key to AWS security.

| **AWS Responsibility**                            | **Your Responsibility**                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure and global network security        | Managing IAM users, groups, roles, and policies    |
| Security of managed services                      | Enabling MFA for all accounts                      |
| Compliance of AWS services                        | Rotating access keys regularly                     |
| Underlying physical and network layers            | Applying least privilege and reviewing permissions |
| Service configurations and vulnerability analysis | Monitoring and auditing IAM activities             |

> AWS secures the **infrastructure**.
> You secure **how** you use that infrastructure.

## **10. Summary**

* **Users** → represent people.
* **Groups** → organize users.
* **Roles** → grant permissions to AWS services.
* **Policies** → define permissions (JSON format).
* **MFA** and strong password policies enhance account security.
* **Access Keys** enable CLI/SDK usage — handle with care.
* **Credentials Report** and **Access Advisor** support auditing and compliance.
* Follow best practices and understand the **Shared Responsibility Model** for secure AWS operations.

✅ **In short:**

> IAM helps define **who can do what** in your AWS environment — securely, efficiently, and with least privilege.
