# 📦 Understanding Kubernetes Pods

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Application is containerized (Docker image built and pushed to Docker Hub or another repo)
- Kubernetes cluster is up and running (can be single-node or multi-node)
- All cluster services are running

## 📦 What is a Pod?
- A Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes
- It encapsulates one or more containers
- Pods are used instead of directly deploying containers to worker nodes
- Commonly, each pod contains only one main container

## 🔄 Scaling Applications
To scale, you create more pods, not more containers inside the same pod.

### Example:
- One pod = One container (web app)
- To scale to handle more users: create multiple identical pods

## 🧩 Multi-Container Pods
Rare but valid use cases when containers need to work tightly together:
- Main web app + helper container
- Sidecar patterns

### Features in Multi-Container Pod:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|:------------|
| Networking | Share network namespace (communicate via localhost) |
| Storage | Can share volumes between containers |
| Lifecycle | Start and stop together |

## 🐳 Comparison to Docker Workflow

### Without Kubernetes:
- Use `docker run` to start containers
- Need to manually:
  - Link containers
  - Share volumes
  - Monitor lifecycles
  - Scale by running multiple commands

### With Kubernetes:
- Pods automate:
  - Networking
  - Storage
  - Lifecycle syncing
- Easier to manage complex apps with helper containers

## 🛠️ How to Deploy a Pod

### Create a Pod:
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```
This creates a pod running an Nginx container.

> Note: Kubernetes pulls the image from Docker Hub by default (unless configured otherwise)

### View Pod Status:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Status progression:
1. ContainerCreating
2. Running

## 🌐 Accessing the Pod
- Pod is not accessible externally by default
- Can be accessed from inside the node
- External access requires Services and Networking (covered later)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- A pod usually wraps one container (simple apps)
- For scaling, you add/delete pods, not containers inside a pod
- Kubernetes simplifies and standardizes deployment, networking, and scaling
- Use kubectl to manage pod lifecycle
