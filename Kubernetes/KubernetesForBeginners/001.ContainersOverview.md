# Containers Overview

## ✅ What is Kubernetes?
- Open-source container orchestration platform
- Originally developed by Google based on their production experience with containers
- Now widely adopted and maintained by the community

## 📌 What Will Be Covered:
- Understanding Containers
- Understanding Orchestration
- High-level introduction to Kubernetes capabilities

## Containers & Docker Overview

### 🎯 Why Docker?
- Resolves compatibility issues with different components (e.g., Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, Ansible)
- Simplifies environment setup for new developers
- Enables consistent environments across dev, test, and production

### ❌ Common Issues Without Docker:
- OS and component/library compatibility problems
- Long and error-prone setup for new developers
- Inconsistent runtime behavior across different environments

### 💡 Docker Solution:
- Runs each component in isolated containers
- Containers include their own libraries and dependencies
- Shared OS kernel but isolated environments

## What are Containers?
- Lightweight, isolated environments sharing the same OS kernel
- Unlike VMs, containers don't have their own OS kernel
- Examples: LXC, LXD, Docker uses LXC containers

## How Docker Works

### OS Structure:
- OS = Linux Kernel + Software (UI, Drivers, Tools, etc.)
- Containers use host OS kernel, and add only the software layer of different OS flavors

### Example:
- Host OS: Ubuntu
- Container: Can be Debian, Fedora, CentOS, etc. (all Linux-based)
- ❌ Cannot run Windows containers on Linux Docker host

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

| Aspect           | Containers (Docker)         | Virtual Machines            |
|-----------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|
| OS Kernel       | Shared with host           | Separate per VM           |
| Boot Time       | Seconds                    | Minutes                   |
| Resource Usage  | Lightweight (MBs)          | Heavy (GBs)              |
| Isolation Level | Moderate                   | High                     |
| Flexibility     | Same kernel only           | Different OS possible    |
| Use Case        | App packaging and shipping | Full OS virtualization   |

## Docker in Practice

### 🧱 Docker Components:
- Images: Templates or packages used to create containers
- Containers: Running instances of Docker images

### 🛠️ How to Use:
- Use public Docker images from Docker Hub (e.g., MongoDB, Redis, Node.js)
- Run applications with simple commands:
```bash
docker run <image_name>
```

### 🌀 Scaling:
- Run multiple instances and place a load balancer in front
- Restart failed containers easily

## Development Workflow with Docker

| Traditional Approach      | Docker-based Approach     |
|-------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Devs write app, Ops deploy | Devs build Docker image  |
| Long setup instructions  | One Dockerfile           |
| Manual setup by Ops      | Image runs everywhere    |
| Errors during deployment | Fewer surprises in Prod  |
