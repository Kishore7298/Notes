# 🚀 Docker vs containerd vs CRI: What's What in Kubernetes?

## 🐳 Docker (Past Mainstream)
- Docker was the original and most popular container runtime
- Early Kubernetes versions were tightly coupled with Docker
- Docker includes multiple tools: CLI, API, build tools, containerd, runc, etc.

## ⚙️ Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
- Introduced by Kubernetes to decouple Kubernetes from Docker
- Allows any compliant runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) to plug in
- Based on OCI standards:
  - Image spec → how container images are built
  - Runtime spec → how to run containers

## 🔧 containerd
- A CRI-compatible container runtime
- Originally part of Docker, now a separate CNCF project
- Lightweight, production-ready alternative to Docker
- Used directly by Kubernetes (since v1.24+) after Docker shim was removed

## 🔨 CLI Tools Comparison

| CLI Tool | Purpose                           | From       | Use Case              | User-friendly? |
|----------|:----------------------------------|:-----------|:---------------------|:--------------|
| ctr      | Low-level debug CLI for containerd| containerd | Debugging only       | ❌ No          |
| nerdctl  | Docker-compatible CLI for containerd| containerd| General-purpose CLI  | ✅ Yes         |
| crictl   | CLI to interact with any CRI runtime| Kubernetes| Debugging containers/pods| ⚠️ Debug only |

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- ❌ Docker is no longer supported as a runtime in Kubernetes (since v1.24)
- ✅ Docker-built images still work (because they follow OCI image spec)

## ✅ TL;DR for Practitioners

### When to Use What:
- Want to manage containers with a Docker-like CLI but without Docker? → Use `nerdctl`
- Want to debug containerd internals? → Use `ctr`
- Want to debug containers/pods running in a K8s node? → Use `crictl`
