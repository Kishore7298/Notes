# Kafka: Creating and Testing a Topic

This guide walks through the basic Kafka setup steps including creating a topic, producing messages, and consuming them—using a local Kafka broker running on `localhost:1992`.

---

## 1. Creating a Topic

In Kafka, a topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.

- **Topic Name:** `loony_topic`
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  kafka-topics.sh --create --topic loony_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
  ```
  - `--create`: Instructs Kafka to create a new topic.
  - `--topic`: Specifies the name of the topic.
  - `--bootstrap-server`: Indicates where the Kafka broker is running.

---

## 2. Verifying Topic Creation

You can confirm that the topic was created by listing and describing the available topics.

- **List all topics:**
  ```bash
  kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
  ```
  ✅ Confirms `loony_topic` now exists.

- **Describe the topic:**
  ```bash
  kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic loony_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
  ```
  **Example output:**
  ```
  Topic: loony_topic    PartitionCount: 1    ReplicationFactor: 1
  ```
  - **PartitionCount = 1:** All messages go to a single partition.
  - **ReplicationFactor = 1:** No redundancy; a broker failure could result in data loss.
  
  These are default settings. In production, higher values are used for scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## 3. Producing Messages to the Topic

Kafka producers publish (write) messages to topics.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  kafka-console-producer.sh --topic loony_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
  ```
  This opens an interactive prompt where you can type and send messages to the topic.

  **Example:**
  ```
  Welcome to Kafka!
  ```

---

## 4. Consuming Messages from the Topic

Kafka consumers subscribe to topics and read published messages.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic loony_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:1992 --from-beginning
  ```
  - `--from-beginning`: Ensures the consumer reads all messages from the start.

  Once the producer sends a message, the consumer receives and prints it immediately.

  **Test messages:**
  - "Welcome to Kafka!"
  - "Does the second message get delivered?"

  Both messages are received successfully.

---

## 5. Validation and Summary

- Kafka is installed and running locally.
- Topic `loony_topic` was created successfully.
- Messages were published by the producer.
- Messages were received by the consumer.

This confirms that your Kafka setup works end-to-end:
- Topic creation
- Message publishing
- Message consumption
