# Kafka: Creating a Topic and Running Producer Performance Tests

Now that the three-broker Kafka cluster is running, you can set up a topic and benchmark producer performance.

---

## 1. Creating a New Topic for Testing

A new Kafka topic named `performance_tuning` is created using the `kafka-topics.sh` script:

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic performance_tuning --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
```
- The `--bootstrap-server` flag helps the client get metadata about the cluster.
- You can list multiple broker addresses for fault tolerance, though one is sufficient for basic use.

After creation, use the `--list` command to confirm the topic exists alongside the earlier `loony_topic`:

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:1992
```

The topic has:
- 1 partition
- Replication factor of 1 (default settings)

---

## 2. Setting Up for Performance Testing

Kafka includes a script called `kafka-producer-perf-test.sh` for benchmarking producer throughput and latency.

- Running `--help` with the script shows available options.
- Key flags used include:
  - `--topic`: Name of the topic to produce to (`performance_tuning`)
  - `--record-size`: Size of each message in bytes (e.g., 1024 = 1KB)
  - `--num-records`: Total number of messages to send (e.g., 25,000)
  - `--throughput`: Set to -1 to send as fast as possible
  - `--producer.config`: Path to the config file for producer settings
  - `--producer-props`: Overrides settings in producer.config if needed
  - `--print-metrics`: Displays more detailed performance statistics

---

## 3. Default Configuration for Baseline Test

- Uses `producer.properties` from Kafka’s config directory.
- Only one broker (`localhost:9092`) is specified as the bootstrap server.
- No configuration values are changed—this run serves as a baseline.
- This helps compare future performance after tweaking producer settings.

## 4. Running the Performance Test

**Command:**
```bash
kafka-producer-perf-test.sh --topic performance_tuning --num-records 25000 --record-size 1024 --throughput -1 --producer.config config/producer.properties | jq
```

**Result from baseline test:**
- Throughput: ~14,534 records/sec
- Avg Latency: ~411.87 ms
- 50th Percentile Latency: 450 ms
- Max and 99th Percentile Latency values also shown
- Throughput (MB/sec): ~14.19 MB/sec

## 5. Optional: Granular Metrics

The `--print-metrics` flag provides a detailed breakdown, including metrics like batch size average, request latencies, and serialization times.

However, for most tuning purposes, only latency and throughput are closely monitored.

---

## Outcome

The Kafka cluster is now ready for producer performance tuning. The baseline metrics will be used for comparison as various producer configurations are tested and optimized.
