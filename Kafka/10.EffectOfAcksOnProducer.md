# Kafka Producer Acknowledgements (acks) Tuning

## 1. What is acks in Kafka Producer?
The `acks` setting controls how many acknowledgements the producer waits for before considering a message "successfully written."

| Acks Value | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 0          | No ack needed; fire-and-forget. Fastest, but least durable. |
| 1          | Wait for ack from the leader broker only. |
| all        | Wait for ack from all in-sync replicas (ISRs). Most durable, but slowest. |

Acks affect durability, latency, and availability.

## 2. Durability vs Availability Trade-off

| Acks | Durability | Availability | Latency      |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0    | ‚ùå Low     | ‚úÖ High      | üü¢ Very Low |
| 1    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium   | üü° Medium   |
| all  | ‚úÖ High    | ‚ùå Low       | üî¥ High     |

- Use `acks=all` if data loss is unacceptable
- Use `acks=0` for high-speed firehose-style ingestion
- Kafka v3+ default is now `acks=all` (previously `acks=1`)

## 3. Demo Setup
- **Topic:** `performance_tuning_topic`
- **Replication Factor:** 3
- **Partitions:** 1
- Each test sends:
  - 25,000 records
  - 1 KB per record
  - Throughput: -1 (unthrottled)
- Used `kafka-producer-perf-test.sh`

## 4. Test Results Comparison

| Acks Value | Records/sec | MB/sec | Avg. Latency (ms) | 50th %ile Latency (ms) |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 0          | 8,716       | 8.51   | 587               | 651                    |
| 1          | 7,598       | 7.42   | 999               | 1,127                  |
| all        | 5,492       | 5.36   | 1,331             | 1,391                  |

**üß† Key Insights:**
- Latency increases as acks level increases.
- Throughput decreases due to waiting on more replicas.
- `acks=all` provides stronger durability guarantees by requiring synchronization with all ISRs.
- Use `acks=1` or `acks=0` only when data loss can be tolerated for the sake of speed.

## 5. Summary

| Acks Setting | Pros                        | Cons                          | Use Case                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| acks=0       | Fastest, low latency        | No durability                 | Log streaming, temporary data            |
| acks=1       | Balanced performance        | Leader-only durability        | Normal operations with backup            |
| acks=all     | Strongest durability guarantee | High latency, lower availability | Financial systems, critical logging   |
