### Reasoning for estimated numbers:

* For 1,000 records (1 KB size), latency is 16.43 ms (given). Throughput not given but likely low due to small test size. Assuming \~500 rec/s throughput (\~0.5 MB/s).

* For 10,000 records (1 KB size), latency not given, but from the trend latency rises with more records, so \~150 ms is reasonable. Throughput will increase from 500 to around 3,000 rec/s (\~3 MB/s).

* For 100,000 records, throughput and MB/s are given (10,513 rec/s and 10.27 MB/s), latency is higher than 10k but likely less than 2,397 ms seen in the large 10k record size test, so estimated \~500 ms.
