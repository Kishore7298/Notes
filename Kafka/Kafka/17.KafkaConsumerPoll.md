# Tuning Max Poll Interval and Max Poll Records in Kafka Consumer

This demo explains how to configure two important consumer properties related to polling:

- **max.poll.records**  
- **max.poll.interval.ms**

---

## What These Properties Do:

- **max.poll.records:**  
  Defines the maximum number of records returned in a single call to `poll()` by the consumer.

- **max.poll.interval.ms:**  
  The maximum allowed delay between consecutive calls to `poll()` by the consumer.  
  If the consumer fails to call `poll()` within this interval, it is considered dead, triggering a rebalance.

---

## Key Points:

- The consumer continuously calls `poll()` to fetch new messages from the subscribed topic.
- Setting `max.poll.interval.ms` too low can cause frequent failures because the consumer does not have enough time to process messages before needing to poll again.
- The value of `max.poll.interval.ms` should reflect the time it takes to process the batch of records fetched by `poll()`.

---

## Demo Walkthrough:

1. **Initial Problematic Configuration:**
   - `max.poll.interval.ms` was set to **10 milliseconds** (too low).
   - Result: Consumer failed with repeated poll timeout errors because it couldn’t call `poll()` frequently enough.

2. **Correct Configuration:**
   - `max.poll.interval.ms` set to **700,000 ms** (700 seconds or ~11 minutes).
   - `max.poll.records` set to **1,000** (up to 1,000 messages fetched per poll).
   - Example logic:
     - If average message processing time is 0.5 seconds,
     - For 1,000 messages, total processing time ≈ 500 seconds,
     - So max poll interval set higher (~700 seconds) to avoid timeout.

3. **Result:**
   - Running the consumer performance test with these values showed no poll timeout warnings.
   - Metrics do not directly show the effect of these properties but understanding their meaning is crucial.

## Practical Tips:

- Calculate your average processing time per message.
- Multiply by `max.poll.records` to estimate total processing time.
- Set `max.poll.interval.ms` accordingly to prevent consumer timeouts and unnecessary rebalances.
- Avoid setting `max.poll.interval.ms` too low to prevent frequent consumer failures.

## Summary:

| Property               | Description                                              | Demo Initial Value | Demo Corrected Value |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `max.poll.records`      | Max records returned in one `poll()` call                | Default (not changed) | 1,000               |
| `max.poll.interval.ms`  | Max delay allowed between consecutive `poll()` calls     | 10 ms              | 700,000 ms (700 sec) |

Understanding and tuning these properties ensures your Kafka consumers can efficiently process large batches of messages without premature session timeouts or rebalances.
