# Kafka Producer Performance: Effects of Replication

## 1. Concept Recap: What is Replication in Kafka?
Replication determines how many copies of each partition exist across brokers.

- One copy is the leader; the others are followers.

**🟢 Benefits of Higher Replication:**
- Better durability (data survives broker failures)
- Higher fault tolerance

**🔴 Trade-offs:**
- Increased replication → more acknowledgment overhead → higher latency
- Reduced producer throughput, especially when `acks=all` is used

## 2. Topic Setup for the Demo
To isolate the impact of replication, three topics were created — all with one partition but different replication factors:

| Topic Name | Partitions | Replication Factor |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| rf_1       | 1          | 1                 |
| rf_2       | 1          | 2                 |
| rf_3       | 1          | 3                 |

Each topic spans 1 to 3 brokers in the Kafka cluster.

**Command used:**
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic rf_X \
  --partitions 1 \
  --replication-factor <1/2/3> \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

## 3. Performance Testing Setup
All tests use `kafka-producer-perf-test.sh` with consistent configuration:
- `--num-records 25000`
- `--record-size 1024` (1 KB each)
- `--throughput -1` (no throttling)
- `--producer.config producer.properties`
- `acks=all` for all tests (ensures durability via acknowledgment from all replicas)

## 4. Performance Test Results

### ✅ Topic: rf_1 (Replication Factor = 1)

| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 25,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 13,888 |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 13.56  |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 353.99 |

> Baseline performance: No replication overhead

### ✅ Topic: rf_2 (Replication Factor = 2)

| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 25,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 7,666  |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 7.49   |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 834.05 ⚠️ |

> Throughput dropped nearly 45%<br>Latency more than doubled from RF=1

### ✅ Topic: rf_3 (Replication Factor = 3)

| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 25,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 6,218  |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 6.07   |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 1196.13 ⚠️ |

> Even lower throughput<br>Latency now 3x higher than RF=1

## 5. Summary of Findings

| Replication Factor | Records/sec | MB/sec | Avg. Latency (ms) |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1                 | 13,888      | 13.56  | 353.99            |
| 2                 | 7,666       | 7.49   | 834.05            |
| 3                 | 6,218       | 6.07   | 1196.13           |

**🧠 Key Insight:**<br>
With `acks=all`, increasing replication significantly reduces throughput and increases producer latency due to the requirement to wait for acknowledgments from all replicas.

---

## 6. Cleanup (Deleting Test Topics)
Topics removed with:
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic rf_1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic rf_2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic rf_3 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

## Final Thoughts
- Use higher replication for critical data durability.
- Be aware of the latency/throughput trade-offs, especially with `acks=all`.
- For performance-sensitive use cases, consider using:
  - `acks=1` (leader-only ack) for lower latency
  - Replication factor of 2 as a balance between durability and latency
