# Tuning Session Timeout and Heartbeat Interval in Kafka Consumer

This demo focuses on configuring two critical consumer properties related to consumer liveness detection:

- **heartbeat.interval.ms**  
- **session.timeout.ms**

---

## What These Properties Do:

- **Heartbeat Interval (`heartbeat.interval.ms`):**  
  How frequently the consumer sends a heartbeat message to the broker to signal that it is still alive.

- **Session Timeout (`session.timeout.ms`):**  
  The maximum time the broker will wait without receiving a heartbeat before considering the consumer dead and removing it from the group.

---

## Important Details:

- If the broker does not receive a heartbeat from the consumer within the session timeout period, it will mark the consumer as dead and trigger a rebalance.
- The **heartbeat interval must be set lower than the session timeout** because the consumer needs to send heartbeats frequently enough to avoid being considered dead.
- Typical default values:
  - `session.timeout.ms` = 10,000 ms (10 seconds)  
  - `heartbeat.interval.ms` = 3,000 ms (3 seconds)

---

## Demo Walkthrough:

1. **Initial Attempt:**
   - Session timeout was set to **10 milliseconds** (too low).
   - The default heartbeat interval of 3,000 ms was higher than the session timeout.
   - Resulted in an exception: *heartbeat must be lower than session timeout*.

2. **Corrected Settings:**
   - Session timeout set to **60,000 ms** (60 seconds).
   - Heartbeat interval set to **20,000 ms** (20 seconds).
   - This means:
     - Consumer sends heartbeat every 20 seconds.
     - Broker waits up to 60 seconds before marking consumer dead.

3. **Performance Test:**
   - With corrected values, the consumer performance test ran successfully.
   - No changes were seen in throughput or consumption metrics because these settings control consumer liveness, not data consumption speed.

---

## Practical Considerations:

- For consumers handling heavy loads or processing large volumes of data, it may be beneficial to **increase both session timeout and heartbeat interval** to avoid unnecessary consumer failures or rebalances.
- Proper tuning ensures consumers are not prematurely marked dead, which stabilizes consumer groups and message processing.

## Summary:

| Property                | Description                                  | Default Value | Demo Value Set |
|-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------|:----------------|
| `session.timeout.ms`    | Max time broker waits for heartbeat           | 10,000 ms     | 60,000 ms     |
| `heartbeat.interval.ms` | Frequency of heartbeat from consumer to broker| 3,000 ms      | 20,000 ms     |
