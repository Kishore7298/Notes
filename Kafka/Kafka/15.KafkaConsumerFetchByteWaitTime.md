# Tuning Kafka Consumer Fetch Bytes and Wait Time

In this part of the demo, the instructor explains how to tweak some important consumer configuration properties by editing the `consumer.properties` file directly. This is necessary because the Kafka consumer performance test script does not support overriding these properties via command-line flags.

## Key Properties Tweaked:

| Property                  | Default Value | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fetch.min.bytes`        | 1 byte        | Minimum data broker must have before responding to fetch        |
| `fetch.max.wait.ms`      | 500 ms        | Maximum broker wait time if fetch.min.bytes not met            |
| `auto.commit.interval.ms`| 5,000 ms      | How often consumer commits read offsets                        |

---

## Default Behavior & Intent:

- Kafka’s default consumer configuration favors **low latency**. That means it sends data as soon as possible—when at least 1 byte is available or after 500 ms wait.
- Lower values for `fetch.min.bytes` and `fetch.max.wait.ms` lead to faster consumption but less efficient batching.
- Reducing the `auto.commit.interval.ms` (e.g., from 5 seconds to 1 second) increases commit frequency, improving durability but potentially lowering throughput because committing more often is resource-intensive.

## Test Results After Tweaking:

### Auto-Commit Interval Impact

| Metric               | Baseline    | After Change | Impact    |
|---------------------|:------------|:-------------|:----------|
| Throughput (MB/s)   | ~25         | ~18          | Decreased |
| Messages/sec        | ~25,600     | ~18,500      | Decreased |
| Fetch Latency (ms)  | 479         | 821          | Increased |

### Fetch Size and Wait Time Test

| Parameter           | Original    | New Value    |
|-------------------|:------------|:-------------|
| `fetch.min.bytes` | 1           | 500,000      |
| `fetch.max.wait.ms`| 500         | 2,500        |

### Partition Fetch Test Setup

| Parameter                    | Default    | Test Value |
|----------------------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Partitions                 | 1          | 3          |
| `max.partition.fetch.bytes`| ~1 MB      | 1,000 bytes|

---

## Increasing Fetch Size and Wait Time:

- The instructor then increased `fetch.min.bytes` to a very large value (e.g., 500,000 bytes) and `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 2,500 ms (2.5 seconds).  
- The idea: The broker would respond only when enough data is accumulated or after a longer wait, improving batch size and throughput but increasing latency.  
- However, on a local single-broker setup, this change was not noticeably reflected in performance metrics. This is common due to limited load and environment.

---

## Additional Tuning - max.partition.fetch.bytes:

- Changed the topic to have 3 partitions to test this property.  
- Lowered `max.partition.fetch.bytes` to 1,000 bytes (from default ~1 MB). This property limits how much data the consumer can fetch in one request per partition.  
- This forces the consumer to make many more fetch requests to get all data.  
- Surprisingly, in this demo, the change did not show measurable impact on throughput or fetch times.  
- Resetting it back to default showed no difference either.  

---

## Key Takeaways:

- Kafka defaults are optimized for low latency and faster consumption with smaller fetch sizes and shorter wait times.  
- Increasing fetch size and wait time can improve throughput by batching, but may increase latency.  
- More frequent commits improve durability but reduce throughput due to overhead.  
- Some tuning effects may be subtle or not visible in a simple local setup with a single broker. They become more important and noticeable in larger, production-like environments with multiple brokers and higher load.
