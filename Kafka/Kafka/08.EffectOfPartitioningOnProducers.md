# Kafka Producer Performance: Effects of Partitioning

## 1. Concept Recap: What is a Partition?
A partition is a unit of parallelism in Kafka.

**Benefits of having multiple partitions:**
- Parallel message production (faster ingestion)
- Parallel writing across brokers (better resource utilization)
- Parallel consumption by consumers (scalable reads)

üìà More partitions generally lead to higher throughput, but excessive partitions may degrade latency and increase system overhead.

## 2. Topic Setup for the Demo
To compare performance across partition counts, the instructor creates three topics:

| Topic Name      | Partitions | Replication Factor |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| partitions_1    | 1          | 1                 |
| partitions_10   | 10         | 1                 |
| partitions_100  | 100        | 1                 |

**Command used:**
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic partitions_X \
  --partitions <1/10/100> \
  --replication-factor 1 \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

**Topics confirmed using:**
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

## 3. Performance Testing Setup
Using:
```bash
kafka-producer-perf-test.sh
```
**Common parameters across all tests:**
- `--num-records 50000`
- `--record-size 1024` (1 KB per message)
- `--throughput -1` (unthrottled)
- `--producer.config config/producer.properties`
- Acknowledgement mode: `acks=all` for full replication safety

## 4. Performance Test Results

### ‚úÖ Topic: partitions_1
| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 50,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 21,168 |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 20.67  |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 384.24 ‚ö†Ô∏è (high) |

> **Observation:** Single partition limits parallelism ‚Üí high latency.

### ‚úÖ Topic: partitions_10
| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 50,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 22,573 |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 22.04  |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 7.19 ‚úÖ (low) |

> **Observation:** Excellent balance. Higher throughput and much lower latency due to parallel writes.

### ‚úÖ Topic: partitions_100
| Metric         | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Records Sent   | 50,000  |
| Throughput (records/s) | 22,925 |
| Throughput (MB/s)      | 22.39  |
| Avg. Latency (ms)      | 8.61   |

> **Observation:** Slight improvement in throughput, but no significant gain over 10 partitions. Latency increases marginally again.

---

## 5. Takeaways: Optimal Partition Strategy
- üîü ~10 partitions is typically optimal for maximizing producer throughput.
- üö´ 100+ partitions may be necessary for logical sharding but not beneficial for raw performance.

**üõë Too Many Partitions Can Hurt:**
- Reduces producer batching effectiveness.
- Increases broker overhead for:
  - Follower fetches
  - Commit time
  - CPU utilization
- Leads to higher latency, more queueing, and resource contention.

## 6. Cleanup (Deleting Test Topics)
Topics cleaned up using:
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic partitions_X --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

## Summary
| Partitions | Records/sec | MB/sec | Avg. Latency (ms) |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1          | 21,168      | 20.67  | 384.24            |
| 10         | 22,573      | 22.04  | 7.19              |
| 100        | 22,925      | 22.39  | 8.61              |

üîº Throughput scales up with partitions, but only to a point.

üü∞ Diminishing returns after ~10 partitions.

‚öñÔ∏è Balance partition count based on:
- Performance
- Application needs
- System resource constraints
