# Producers and Consumers

---

## Producer Acknowledgements

- **`acks=0`**:  
  The producer does not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker.  
  - **Pros**: Fastest option.  
  - **Cons**: Risk of message loss if a broker fails.

- **`acks=1`**:  
  The producer waits for an acknowledgement from the partition leader only.  
  - **Pros**: Balances speed and reliability.  
  - **Cons**: If the leader fails, the message may be lost.

- **`acks=all`**:  
  The producer waits for acknowledgements from the partition leader and all replicas.  
  - **Pros**: Ensures the highest reliability.  
  - **Cons**: May increase latency.

## Message Ordering

- **Single Partition**:  
  Consumers reading from a single partition receive messages in the exact order they were written.

- **Multiple Partitions**:  
  When consumers read from multiple partitions, Kafka does not guarantee the order of messages.

## Consumer Groups

- A **consumer group** consists of multiple consumers that work together to consume data from one or more topics.
- **Partition Assignment**:  
  - Partitions of the topics are divided among the consumers in the group, balancing the load.
  - If new consumers join or existing consumers leave the group, Kafka rebalances the partitions among the current consumers.
  - This ensures each consumer gets a fair share of partitions.

## Rebalancing

- **What is Rebalancing?**  
  Rebalancing occurs when there are changes in the consumer group membership.

- **Example**:  
  - If a topic has 4 partitions and there is 1 consumer, that consumer reads from all 4 partitions.  
  - If a new consumer joins, the partitions are split between the two consumers.  
  - If there are 4 consumers, each reads from 1 partition.  
  - If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle.
