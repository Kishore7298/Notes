# Kafka: Running a Cluster with Three Brokers

This guide covers how to set up and run a Kafka cluster with three brokers on a single local machine—mimicking a more realistic multi-broker setup used in production.

---

## 1. Real-World Context

Most real-world Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers, often running in different data centers and geo regions.

- While enterprise clusters may have hundreds or thousands of brokers, a minimum of three brokers is recommended.
- In this setup, all three brokers will run locally, not distributed across different machines or regions.

---

## 2. Configuration Setup

Navigate to the Kafka config directory, which contains all Kafka component configuration files.

Use a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open and modify:
- `server-0.properties`
- `server-1.properties`
- `server-2.properties`

Each file corresponds to a single Kafka broker.

## 3. Configuring Each Broker

**Broker 0 – `server-0.properties`**
```properties
broker.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9092
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-0
```

**Broker 1 – `server-1.properties`**
```properties
broker.id=1
listeners=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9093
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9093
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-1
```

**Broker 2 – `server-2.properties`**
```properties
broker.id=2
listeners=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9094
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9094
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-2
```

> **Note:**
> - Each broker ID must be unique.
> - Each port number must be unique.
> - Each broker should log to a separate directory.

## 4. Starting the Kafka Cluster

### Step 1: Restart Zookeeper
First, ensure that the previous Zookeeper instance (if any) is stopped.

- **Start a fresh Zookeeper instance:**
  ```bash
  bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
  ```

### Step 2: Start Brokers
Open a new terminal window for each broker.

- **Broker 0:**
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-0.properties
  ```
- **Broker 1:**
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-1.properties
  ```
- **Broker 2:**
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-2.properties
  ```

---

## 5. Outcome

At this point, a Kafka cluster with three brokers is successfully running locally.

Each broker has:
- A unique ID
- A distinct port
- Its own log directory

This setup simulates a multi-broker environment similar to what is used in real-world deployments, though all brokers are on the same machine.
