# An Overview of Kafka

## Kafka Architecture
Kafka is a distributed platform designed to handle streaming data. At its core is the **Kafka cluster**, which consists of multiple servers known as **Kafka brokers**.

---

## Producers and Consumers

### Producers
- Entities that publish messages to the Kafka cluster.
- They send messages to specific **topics**.

### Consumers
- Entities that subscribe to topics and consume messages from the Kafka cluster.
- Producers and consumers are decoupled via topics, meaning they do not directly interact with each other.

---

## Topics and Partitions

### Topics
- Logical groupings or queues of messages.
- Can have multiple producers and consumers.

### Partitions
- Each topic is divided into **partitions**, which are separate queues that allow for distributed placement of events.
- Partitions are essential for Kafka's scalability.
- Messages are typically distributed across partitions in a **round-robin** manner by default.

## Message Ordering
- Consumers reading from a **single partition** will receive messages in the order they were written.
- If consumers read from **multiple partitions**, Kafka does not guarantee the order of messages.

---

## Message Keys
- Messages can be associated with **keys**, ensuring that messages with the same key are always sent to the same partition.
- This helps maintain order for specific sets of messages.

---

## Replication
- Partitions can be **replicated** across multiple brokers to ensure fault-tolerance and high availability.
- Each partition has a **leader** responsible for receiving messages and syncing them with replicas.
- The **replication factor** determines how many copies of a partition exist across brokers.
